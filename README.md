# An Open Source PageRank Implementation in C

An open source PageRank implementation in C, implemented as described in David Austingâ€™s How Google Finds Your Needle in the Web's Haystack. The algorithm handles large hyperlink graphs with millions of vertices and arcs.

# Building

The project is written in standard C and can be built by running:

    make

# Usage

pagerank is invoked by

    ./pagerank -I [number of iterations] -A [alpha] network_file.net

where options may be:

* -A: Alpha parameter (see Google formula).

* -I: Number of iterations.

where input file is in the following format (see example.net):

    Number of pages
    Link 1
    Link 2
    ...
    
    

# Testing

Unit tests are available in test_main.c
